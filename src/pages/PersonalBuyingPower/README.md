# Personal Buying Power

- How many x can I buy for my current salary?
e.g. An iPhone 14 (256GB) costs today `134,800円` and my yearly salary is `12,757,376円`
which means I can buy: `94.64` iPhones for my yearly salary.

This number, over time, is interesting as it will go up or down.
What is affecting this number is:
* The price
* My salary

This is not the inflation of the country, but my own personal inflation based on my salary.
In the end I will be able to get an answer for the question:
- Am I getting richer or poorer?
